Comprehensive UI testing of the Business Request workflow completed using test credentials test_officer@sourcevia.com / Password123!. ✅ SUCCESSFUL TESTS: Login authentication working perfectly ✓, Business Requests page accessible with proper header and filter buttons ✓, My Approvals page fully functional with stats cards (Pending: 0, Approved: 0, Rejected: 0), tabs (Pending/History), and 'No pending approvals' message ✓, Navigation changes verified - Invoices and Payment Auth correctly removed, My Approvals present in sidebar ✓. ⚠️ ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Business Request detail page navigation not working - clicking on business request cards does not navigate to detail view. Backend APIs are working (tested via curl), but frontend routing or click handlers may have issues. The detail page components (Workflow Status Banner, Available Actions, Main Info, Proposals sections) could not be tested due to navigation issue. All other workflow UI components are production-ready, but detail page navigation needs main agent investigation."
